If we list all the natural numbers below ```10``` that are multiples of ```3``` or ```5```, we get ```3, 5, 6 and 9```. The sum of these multiples is ```23```.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both ```3``` and ```5```, only count it once.
